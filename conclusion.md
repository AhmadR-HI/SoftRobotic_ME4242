## 4. Conclusion
Overall, the proposed design of the growing robot with suction gripper was effective to a certain extent in completing the mission objective. While the grabbing of the ball by the gripper and locomotion of the growing robot were successful, the bending and turning of the end-effector had a low success rate and remains a major challenge in the robot’s navigation through the T-slot and S-shaped path. Furthermore, key issues to be kept in mind include possible ruptures in the growing robot, connection between the roller and outer cap, and the end-effector needing to adjust for differing tube diameters (i.e. the connectors & transparent tubes, as well as the S-shaped path).
## 4.1 Future Work and Potential Improvements

We plan to enhance our robot’s performance by improving our soft actuator fabrication and system robustness. Our first modification is to degas our silicone bellows actuators after molding during fabrication using a vacuum chamber. This would eliminate porosity and weak interlinks thus allowing for smoother bending without getting stuck in the pipe. The coupling between the end effector and the inner roller must be modified to prevent separation. The main growing body can be reinforced by making it a multilayered laminated structure thus reducing potential rupture while supporting higher pressures. The pressure chamber can be redesigned to include a feeding mechanism for smoother extraction. A mini camera can be integrated with the end effector to give visual guidance during bending to minimise jamming. Our pneumatic-electronic control system can be upgraded to control multiple actuators simultaneously. Lastly, we would redesign our main robot by potentially exploring a hybrid between our prototypes 1 and 2 to create a more versatile and robust robot.
