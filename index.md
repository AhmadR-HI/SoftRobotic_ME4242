## 1. Introduction

Gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures are a minimally invasive, nonsurgical method for physicians to examine a patient’s digestive tract in order to diagnose and occasionally treat conditions such as ulcers, polyps, and gastrointestinal cancers. Most current endoscopes include long, thin tubes with attached lights and cameras that are inserted via the mouth or rectum, removing the need for an incision. Tools can also be inserted into said tube, allowing for minor surgical procedures such as removing blockages or collecting biopsies.[1] While current endoscopic procedures are quite effective, there are still risks of tissue or organ perforation, bleeding, or incomplete removal of polyps. This is mainly due to the rigidity of current tools and the doctor’s experience level. The introduction of soft robotic tools in endoscopic procedures reduces these risks. By nature, soft robotic tools are biocompatible, flexible, “squeezeable”, and have variable stiffness, making them much more ergonomic to navigate within the body without risk of perforation.[2] 

In this surgical challenge, we were tasked with creating a soft robot to navigate an enlarged model imitating the intestinal tract and retrieve a “blockage”. Our robot’s manipulation and locomotion needed to be powered by soft fluidic actuators, able to make turns, and able to collect and return with the “blockage”. After several iterations, our solution was to create a growing robot, directionally controlled by two silicone bellows actuators, with a suction-based actuator retrieval system. In this paper, we describe our brainstorming, prototyping, and fabrication processes, as well as the various iterations of our robot.
